title: 'Query Language Guide'
---

Hister provides a query language that allows you to search through your content with precision. This guide explains the different query types and search techniques available.

## Basic Search

Simply type any word to search across all fields:

```textplain
hister
```

This searches for "hister" in the title, text content, URL, and domain of all indexed pages.

## Quoted Phrases

Use double quotes to search for exact phrases:

```textplain
"privacy policy"
```

This finds pages containing the exact phrase "privacy policy" (not just pages with both words separately).

**Examples:**

```textplain
"self-hosted applications"
"data privacy regulations"
"end-to-end encryption"
```

## Field-Specific Searches

You can search within specific fields using the `field:value` syntax:

### Available Fields

- **title:** - Search in page titles only
- **text:** - Search in page content only
- **url:** - Search in URLs only (bare file paths without `://` are automatically resolved to absolute `file://` URLs)
- **domain:** - Search in domain names only
- **language:** - Filter by detected language (e.g., `en`, `de`, `fr`. Use `unknown` for languages Hister doesn't support)
- **type:** - Filter by document type (`web` for websites, `file` or `local` for local files)
- **user_id:** - Filter by user ID (admin use; e.g., `user_id:3`)

**Examples:**

```textplain
title:encryption
```

Finds pages with "encryption" in the title.

```textplain
domain:github.com
```

Finds all pages from github.com.

```textplain
url:*/security/*
```

Finds pages with "security" in the URL path.

```textplain
text:"GDPR compliance"
```

Finds pages with "GDPR compliance" in the body text.

```textplain
language:en
```

Finds pages detected as English language.

```textplain
type:file
```

Finds local files (indexed from filesystem).

```textplain
type:web
```

Finds web pages (indexed from URLs).

```textplain
user_id:3
```

Finds all documents belonging to user with ID 3 (admin only).

```textplain
url:/home/<user>/documents/report.pdf
```

Finds the local file at that path (resolved to an absolute `file://` URL automatically).

### Privacy & Security Examples

```textplain
title:privacy domain:mozilla.org
title:"security audit" text:vulnerability
url:*/privacy-policy
domain:privacyguides.org text:encryption
language:en type:web
user_id:3 domain:example.com
```

## Wildcard Searches

Use asterisks (`*`) for wildcard matching:

```textplain
secur*
```

Matches: security, secure, securing, etc.

```textplain
*privacy*
```

Matches: privacy, myprivacy, privacytools, etc.

**Field-specific wildcards:**

```textplain
domain:*.github.io
url:*/docs/*
title:*firewall*
```

## Negation

Prefix terms with a minus sign (`-`) to exclude results:

```textplain
privacy -facebook
```

Finds pages about privacy but excludes results containing "facebook".

```textplain
encryption title:-tutorial
```

Finds pages about encryption but not those with "tutorial" in the title.

**Field-specific negation:**

```textplain
security -domain:facebook.com
title:hister -url:*/issues/*
privacy -"social media"
-language:en
-type:file
```

## Alternation Expressions

Use parentheses with pipe (`|`) to create OR conditions:

```textplain
(security|privacy|encryption)
```

Finds pages containing any of these terms.

```textplain
title:(firewall|vpn|proxy)
```

Finds pages with firewall, VPN, or proxy in the title.

### Combining with Other Queries

```textplain
"data protection" (GDPR|CCPA|HIPAA)
```

Finds pages about data protection mentioning any of these regulations.

```textplain
domain:(github.com|gitlab.com) title:security
```

Finds security-related pages from GitHub or GitLab.

## Combining Query Types

You can combine all query types for powerful searches:

```textplain
title:encryption "end-to-end" domain:(signal.org|whatsapp.com) -deprecated
```

This finds pages where:

- "encryption" appears in the title
- Contains the phrase "end-to-end"
- From signal.org OR whatsapp.com domains
- Does NOT contain "deprecated"

### Real-World Examples

**Finding privacy tools:**

```textplain
(privacy|security) tools "open source" -commercial type:web
```

**Research on specific topics:**

```textplain
"threat model" (encryption|authentication|authorization) -tutorial language:en
```

**Documentation searches:**

```textplain
title:(setup|installation|configuration) domain:(*.io|*.dev) hister
```

**Local code documentation:**

```textplain
type:file (README|documentation) language:en
```

**Security vulnerabilities:**

```textplain
(CVE|vulnerability|exploit) (2024|2025|2026) -"not affected" type:web
```

**Self-hosting resources:**

```textplain
"self-hosted" (docker|kubernetes|compose) title:(guide|tutorial)
```

## Tips

### 1. Case Insensitivity

All searches are case-insensitive:

```textplain
Privacy = privacy = PRIVACY
```

### 2. Wildcards and Performance

- Leading wildcards (`*term`) are slower than trailing wildcards (`term*`)
- Starting query with `*` immediately tries to find every document, that can lead to performance issues
- Use field-specific wildcards when possible for better performance

### 3. Empty Alternations

Alternations must contain at least one option:

```textplain
()           # Invalid
(a)          # Valid - single option
(a|b)        # Valid - multiple options
```

## Query Best Practices

### Start Broad, Then Narrow

```textplain
# Start with:
encryption

# Refine to:
encryption privacy

# Further refine:
"end-to-end encryption" (signal|matrix) -deprecated
```

### Use Field Searches for Precision

Instead of:

```textplain
github security issue
```

Try:

```textplain
domain:github.com title:(security|vulnerability) -closed
```

### Combine Phrases with Alternations

```textplain
"privacy policy" (updated|changed|revised) (2025|2026)
```

## Common Use Cases

### Finding Documentation

```textplain
title:(docs|documentation|guide) domain:*.io hister
```

### Research Topic

```textplain
"zero-knowledge" (encryption|proof|architecture) -marketing
```

### Tracking Updates

```textplain
domain:mozilla.org (firefox|thunderbird) "release notes"
```

### Security News

```textplain
(vulnerability|CVE|security) "disclosure" -duplicate
```

### Privacy Tools Comparison

```textplain
"privacy" (comparison|vs|versus) (browser|vpn|email)
```

## Troubleshooting Queries

### No Results Found

- Remove field restrictions and try a broader search
- Check spelling and try wildcards
- Remove negations to see what's being excluded
- Simplify alternations

### Too Many Results

- Add field-specific searches
- Use quoted phrases for exact matches
- Add negations to filter out unwanted content
- Specify domains to narrow scope

### Unexpected Results

- Ensure quotes are properly closed
- Check that parentheses are balanced
- Verify field names are spelled correctly (`title`, `text`, `url`, `domain`, `language`, `type`, `user_id`)
- Remember searches are case-insensitive
- For type filter, use "web" or "file" (also accepts "local" for files)
